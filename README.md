Cuhre.jl
=========

Provides a subset of the functionality of the Cuhre routine from the [Cuba package](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) of integration routines.

The simplifications made to the cuhre call are:

Always set nvec = 1, key = 0, spin = -1.

The name of the statefile is randomly generated for each invocation.
